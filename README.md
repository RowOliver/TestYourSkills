# TestYourSkills

Objective:
To create a quiz that would have a timer that counted down when the user presses start and then would subtract time if the answer was incorrect. 

Strategies:

My main goal was to get the timer to function.

Then I created a function that would start the game

User Story:
WHEN the user clicks the Start Button 
THEN the user is prompted through questions 
AND the timer begins to countdown 
THEN depending on the answers to the questions the user will get more or less time 
THEN the user may put their initials to be stored and showed off to other players
